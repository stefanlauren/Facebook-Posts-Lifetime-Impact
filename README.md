# Facebook-Posts-Lifetime-Impact
Using the “dataset_Facebook.csv” data set, I conducted exploration and leverage appropriate transformations and machine learning techniques to understand the factors which contribute to the lifetime impact of Facebook posts.

The input features concerning the posts are (category, page total likes, type, month, hour, weekday, paid). These are the features I model against. The remaining features are all performance metrics which I am predicting.
